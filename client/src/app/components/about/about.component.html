      <h2>Description</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <span class="span-outline">lepeerchat</span> is an experimental project
        about <strong>decentralizing communications</strong>. The application
        leverages the
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC"
          title="Web Real-Time Communication"
          >WebRTC</a
        >
        technology to enable sharing textual, vocal or video data in a
        <span class="span-outline">peer-to-peer</span> manner. As a result,
        paired users of the application can directly communicate with each
        other, without the need for their data to be relayed by a central
        server.
      </div>
      <div id="requirements" class="requirements">
        The project (loosely) follows a set of requirements (unordered):
        <ul class="u-list">
          <li>no registration needed</li>
          <li>peer-to-peer communications</li>
          <li>seamless pairing</li>
          <li>fairly easy to use</li>
          <li>free service (to the extent of the hosting server's capacity)</li>
          <li>
            secureâ„¢ (more on that
            <a routerLink="./" fragment="security">later</a>)
          </li>
          <li>
            free (<a

            >)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="trivia">
        <span class="trivia-title">Trivia</span>: in french, the word
        <span class="span-outline">peer</span> is homonymous with
        <span class="span-outline">pire</span>, which translates to
        <span class="span-outline">worst</span> in english, which makes this
        website's name a lot more apporpriate!
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="usage">
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <div class="basic-usage">
        In order to communicate with another user, one must:
        <ol class="o-list">
          <li><a routerLink="/create">create a new room</a></li>
          <li>
            generate an invitation and share it via a third party (see
            <a routerLink="./" fragment="limitations">limitations</a>) with the
            other user(s)
          </li>
          <li>wait for them to join the room</li>
          <li>chat textually or vocally with everyone in the room</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        Since there is no registration system, the application relies on signed
        tokens (stored locally in the navigator) to identify users upon room
        access. That means, one can safely close or refresh the page and still
        be able to access old rooms again (granted they are still alive).
      </div>
      <div>
        Rooms are automatically discarded
        <span class="span-outline">30 minutes</span> after the
        <strong>last</strong> user left the room. Put in another way, a room
        lives as long as there is <strong>at least 1 user connected</strong> to
        it, but dies if this condition isn't met for
        <span class="span-outline">30 minutes</span>.
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <div>
        Several features provide security on key points of the application:
        <div>
          On the technical scale:
          <ul class="u-list">
            <li>
              <span class="span-outline">client</span> and
              <span class="span-outline">server</span> only exchange data via
              <span class="span-outline">HTTPS</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              when paired with another peer, WebRTC uses
              <span class="span-outline">DTLS-SRTP</span> to add encryption,
              message authentication and integrity to the data being exchanged.
            </li>
            <li>
              data sent by the <span class="span-outline">client</span> to the
              <span class="span-outline">server</span> is immediatlely and
              strictly checked against expected structures, preventing abuses
              from the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              data sent by a <span class="span-outline">peer</span> to another
              <span class="span-outline">peer</span> is immediatlely and
              strictly checked against expected structures, preventing abuses
              from other peers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          On the application scale:
          <ul class="u-list">
            <li>
              only 2 ways of joining a room:
              <ul class="u-list">
                <li>
                  via a shared <strong>private invitation</strong> link (which
                  is extremely difficult to guess and expires after
                  <span class="span-outline">1h</span>).
                </li>
                <li>
                  automatically, via a <strong>token</strong>, redeemed from
                  having previously joined the room (via invitation).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              when successfully joining a room, a user is delivered a signed
              <strong>token</strong>
              automatically proving his identity in his subsequent connections
              to the room.
            </li>
            <li>
              a room can be <span class="span-outline">locked</span> to prevent
              <strong>new</strong> invited users from joining (users that
              previously joined the room aren't considered "new").
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

    <section id="project-structure">
      <h2>Project structure</h2>
      <div>
        The application simply consists of 2 components:
        <ul class="u-list">
          <li>
            <span class="span-outline">client application</span>: the user
            facing application. It acts as the entry point for room creation,
            initiates user pairing and visually presents transmitted data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="span-outline">websocket server</span>: the
            <span class="span-outline">client application</span>'s backend. It
            keeps track of each room and user state, and plays the broker during
            the WebRTC signaling process.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="limitations">
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <div>
        This web application has some limitations:
        <ul class="u-list">
          <li>
            the application lacks a
            <span class="span-outline">relay/TURN server</span>, which would
            help in keeping the website usable for users whose connections with
            other peers are impossible because of their firewall blocking NAT
            traversal
          </li>
          <li>
            users need a third-party communication tool in order to share a room
            invitation link, which is inconvenient but imposed as per the
            <a routerLink="./" fragment="requirements"
              >"registration-free" requirement</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            due to the peer-to-peer nature of the communications, the quality of
            the streamed and recieved media will deteriorate as more peers join.
          </li>
        </ul>
